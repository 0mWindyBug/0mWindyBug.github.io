Introduction
---
Over the years, the security community as a whole realized that there needed to be a way to stop exploit developers from easily executing malicious shellcode. Microsoft, over time, has implemented a plethora of intense exploit mitigations, such as: [EMET (the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2458544/the-enhanced-mitigation-experience-toolkit), [CFG (Control Flow Guard)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard), [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/10/23/windows-defender-exploit-guard-reduce-the-attack-surface-against-next-generation-malware/), and [ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dynamicbase-use-address-space-layout-randomization?view=vs-2019).

[DEP](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/875352/a-detailed-description-of-the-data-execution-prevention-dep-feature-in), or Data Execution Prevention, is another one of those roadblocks that hinders exploit developers. This blog post will only focusing on defeating DEP, within a stack based data structure on Windows. 

A Brief Word About DEP
---
Windows XP SP2 32 bit was the first Windows operating system to ship DEP. Every version of Windows since then has included DEP, DEP, at a high level, gives memory two independent permission levels. They are:
- The ability to write to memory.

  __OR__

- The ability to execute memory.

But not both.

What this means, is that someone cannot write ___AND___ execute memory at the same time. This means a few things for exploit developers. Let's say you have a simple vanilla stack instruction pointer overwrite. Let's also say the first byte, and all of the following bytes of your payload, are pointed to by the stack pointer. Normally, a simple `jmp stack pointer` instruction would suffice- and it would rain shells. With DEP, it is not that simple. Since that shellcode is user introduced shellcode- you will be able to write to the stack. BUT, as soon as any execution of that user supplied shellcode is attempted- an access violation will occur, and the application will terminate.

DEP manifests itself in four different policy settings. From the MSDN documentation on DEP. here are the four policy settings:

Knowing the applicable information on how DEP is implemented, figuring how to defeat DEP is the next viable step.

Windows API, We Meet Again
---

In my [last post](https://connormcgarr.github.io/WS32_recv()-Reuse/), I explained and outlined how powerful the Windows API is. Microsoft has released all of the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list) ono the Windows API, which aids in reverse engineering the process of utilizing the API.

Defeating DEP is no different. There are many API functions that can be used to defeat DEP. A few of them include:
- __[VirtualProtect()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect)__
- __[VirtualAlloc()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc)__
- __[WriteProcessMemory()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory)__
- __[HeapCreate()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapcreate)__

But the only limitation to defeating DEP, is the number of applicable APIs in Windows that change the permissions of the memory containing shellcode.

For this post, `VirtualProtect()` will be the Windows API function used for bypassing DEP.

`VirtualProtect` takes the following parameters:
```c++
BOOL VirtualProtect(
  LPVOID lpAddress,
  SIZE_T dwSize,
  DWORD  flNewProtect,
  PDWORD lpflOldProtect
);
```

`lpAddress` = A pointer an address that describes the starting page of the region of pages whose access protection attributes are to be changed.

`dwSize` = The size of the region whose access protection attributes are to be changed, in bytes.

`flNewProtect` = The memory protection option. This parameter can be one of the memory protection constants. (`0x40` sets the permissions of the memory page to read, write, and execute.)

`lpflOldProtect` = A pointer to a variable that receives the previous access protection value of the first page in the specified region of pages. (This should be any address that already contains write permissions)

Now this is all great and fine, but there is a question one should be asking themselves. If it is not possible to write the parameters to the stack and also execute them, how will the function even get executed?

Let' ROP!

This is where Return Oriented Programming comes in. Even when DEP is enabled, it is still possible to perform operations on the stack such as `push`, `pop`, `add`, `sub`, etc.

"How is that so? I thought it was not possible to write and execute on the stack?" This is a question you also may be having.
