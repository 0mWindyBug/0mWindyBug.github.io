Over the years, the security community as a whole realized that there needed to be a way to stop exploit developers from easily executing malicious shellcode. Over the years, Microsoft has implemented a plethora of intense exploit mitigations, such as: [EMET (the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2458544/the-enhanced-mitigation-experience-toolkit), [CFG (Control Flow Guard)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard), [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/10/23/windows-defender-exploit-guard-reduce-the-attack-surface-against-next-generation-malware/), and [ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dynamicbase-use-address-space-layout-randomization?view=vs-2019).
