Introduction
---
As I am currently preparing for Offensive Security's [Advanced Windows Exploitation](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/advanced-windows-exploitation.pdf) course, I realized I had a disconnect with some prerequisite knowledge needed to succeed in the course (and in my personal exploit development growth). Among those topics, was kernel exploitation in a Windows environment. A professor, whom I am very close with, once explained to me many moons ago about kernel debugging. He explained it was done remotely, instead of locally (which is what I currently had experience with up until this point). Up until now, that was the only knowledge I had about anything related to the kernel.

Today, I just wanted to document a few things I have done in preparation for the AWE course coming up this year at BlackHat (where I will opefully get a seat). Among these are: how to use WinDbg at a high level (I have experience with WinDbg, but I want to get better, as this is what is used in the AWE course), how to use IDA freeware at a high level (reasoning is synonymous with WinDbg explanation), and how to exploit a vulnerable Windows kernel driver. The vulnerable driver I will be analyzing and exploiting today is from the HackSysExtreme team, with their [HackSysExtreme Vulnerable Driver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver). I cannot stress enough how much HackSysExtreme has done for vulnerability researchers. With that said, let's get into the debugging environment setup.
