Introduction

Previously, I have [blogged](https://connormcgarr.github.io/ROP2) about ROP and the benefits of understanding how it works. Not only is it a viable first-stage payload for obtaining native code execution, it can also be leveraged for things like arbitrary read/write primitives and data-only attacks. Unfortunately, if your end goal is native code execution, there is a good chance you are going to need to overwrite a function pointer in order to hijack control flow. Taking this into consideration, Microsoft implemented [Control Flow Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard), or CFG, as an optional update back in Windows 8.1. Although it was released before Windows 10, it did not really catch on in terms of "main stream" exploitation until recent years.
