"Can you please update the course materials?" "I'll take this course when the materials are updated!" These are some of the retorts I frequently see, in response to words of commendation and praise that the Offensive Security community attribute to the _Cracking The Perimeter_ course and OSCE exam.

_Cracking The Perimeter_, stylized as _CTP_, is the accompanying course to the Offensive Security Certificed Expert (OSCE). This course is often seen as "outdated". There is a reason why Offensive Security certifications do not have an expiration date. There is a reason why very few of the courses receive updates. There are reasons why Offensive Security alumni are frequently sought out in the information security market. I will hit on all of these notions in the middle and latter parts of this post.

What are the prerequisites to this course?

Are you an [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional)alumni? Did you love the exploit development section of the [_PWK_](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux) course? Do you just have an overall interest in the exploit development lifecycle, x86 assembly, web applications, and infrastructure exploitation?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, this course and exam are probably for you. One thing to note as well, there is a common misconception that one must have the OSCP and/or completing the PWK course.
