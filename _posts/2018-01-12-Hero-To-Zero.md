"Wait, Kali Linux is the same thing as Linux?" I remember the sheer embarrassment hitting my face. This was me, a 20 year old novice in August of 2017 at one of my school's Cyber Defense Club meetings. In the world of information security, where there are ground breaking developments everyday- I had just came to the realization there are more distributions of Linux other than Ubuntu. In this moment I realized I was being left in the dust by my peers, and a change was needed. This is the first of many events that propelled me to the elation I felt when read the words "...allow us to be the first to congratulate you on your OSCP certification" in an email from Offensive Security. In this blog post I am going to elaborate a little on my background at the time I passed my OSCP in September, speak on my path to the cert, provide some resources I found useful, and debunk a few myths I encountered on my journey, that almost deterred me from the challenge.

Pre-PWK/OSCP Background

Let me preface this portion of the blog with this- PWK is an acronym for Penetration Testing with Kali Linux. This is the accompoanying course to the OSCP certification, and must be completed before an attempt at OSCP can be made. My journey begins in November 2017, during my Thanksgiving break at school. I was three years into a degree in cybersecurity at Southeast Missouri State University- and this was the extent of my knowledge at this point. I never made any efforts outside of class at this point. The notion that I was going to be left behind my be peers led me to [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) where I took a course on learning the command line in Linux.
