"Wait, Kali Linux is the same thing as Linux?" I remember the sheer embarrassment hitting my face. This was me, a 20 year old novice in August of 2017. In the world of information security, where there are ground breaking developments everyday- I had just figured out there are more distributions of Linux other than Ubuntu. In this moment, I realized I was being left in the dust by my peers and a change was needed. This is the first of many events that propelled me to the elation I felt when read the words "...allow us to be the first to congratulate you on your OSCP certification" from Offensive Security. In this blog post I am going to elaborate a little on my background at the time I passed my OSCP in September, speak on my path to the cert, and debunk a few myths I encountered on my journey, that almost deterred me from the challenge.
