Introduction

I recently have been spending the last few days working on obtaining some more experience with reverse engineering to complement my exploit development background. During this time, I stumbled across [this](https://labs.bluefrostsecurity.de/blog/2019/09/07/bfs-ekoparty-2019-exploitation-challenge/) challenge put on by Blue Frost Security earlier this year in September that requires both reverse engineering skills and exploit development skills. Although I would by no means consider myself an expert in reverse engineering, I decided this would be a nice way to try to become more well versed with the entire development lifecycle starting with identifying vulnerabilities to developing a functioning exploit.

Before we begin, I will be using using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and [IDA Freeware 64-bit](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/) to reverse the eko2019.exe application and [WinDbg](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) to develop the exploit. I prefer to use IDA to view the execution of a program- but I prefer to use the Ghidra decompiler to view the code that the program is comprised of. In addition to the aforementioned information, this exploit will be developed on Windows 10 x64 RS2, due to the fact the I already had a VM with this OS ready to go. This exploit will work up to Windows 10 x64 RS6 (1903 build), although the offsets between addresses will differ.

Starting the application, we can clearly see the server has echoed some text into the command prompt where the server is running.

After some investigation, it seems this application binds to port 54321. Looking at the text in the command prompt window leads me to believe `printf()`, or similar functions, must have been called in order for the application to display this text. I am also inclined to believe that these print functions must be located somewhere around the routine that is responsible for opening up a socket on port 54321 and accepting messages. Let's crack open eko2019.exe in IDA and see if our hypothesis is correct.

By opening the __Strings__ subview in IDA, we can identify all of the strings within eko2019.exe.

As we can see from the above image, we have identified a string that seems like a good place to start! `"[+] Message received: %i bytes\n"` is indicative that the server has received a connection and message from the client (us). The function/code that is responsible for incoming connections may be around where this string is located. By double-clicking on `.data:000000014000C0A8` (the address of this string), we can get a better look at the internals of the eko2019.exe application, as shown below.

Perfect! We have identified where the string `"[+] Message received: %i bytes\n"` resides. In IDA, we have the ability to cross reference where a function, routine, instruction, etc. resides. This functionality is outlined by __DATA XREF: sub_1400011E0+11E↑o__, which is a cross reference of data in this case in the above image. If we double click on `sub_1400011E0+11E↑o` in the __DATA XREF__ comment, we will land on the function in which the `"[+] Message received: %i bytes\n"` string resides.

Nice! As we can see from the above image, the place in which this string resides, is location (loc) `loc_1400012CA`. If we trace execution back to where it originated, we can see that the function we are inside is `sub_1400011E0`.

After looking around this function for awhile, it is evident this is the function that handles connections and messages! Knowing this, let's head over to Ghidra and decompile this function to see what is going on.

Opening the function in Ghidra's decompiler, a few things stand out to us, as outlined in the image below.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/BFS_6.png" alt="">

Number one, The `local_258` variable is initialized with the `recv()` function. The `recv()` function makes the function call with:
- A socket file descriptor, `param_1`, which is inherited from the `void FUN_1400011e0` function parameters
- A pointer to where the buffer that was received will be written to (`local_28`)
- The specified length which `local_28` should be (0x10 hexadecimal bytes/16 decimal bytes)
- Zero, which represents what flags should be implemented (none in this case).

What this means, is that the size of the request received by the `recv()` function will be stored in the variable `local_258`.

This is how the call looks, disassembled, within IDA.

The next line of code after the value of `local_258` is set, is a call to `printf()` which displays a message indicating the "header" has been received, `local_258` being printed.

```c
printf(s__[+]_Header_received:_%i_bytes_14000c008,(ulonglong)local_258)
```

We can interpret this behavior, as that eko2019.exe seems to accept a header before the "message" portion of the client request is received. This header must be 0x10 hexadecimal bytes (16 decimal bytes) in length. This is the first "check" the application makes on our request, thus being the first "check" we must bypass.

Number two, after the header is received by the program, the specific variable that contains pointer to the buffer received by the previous `recv()` request (`local_28`) is compared to the string constant `0x393130326f6b45`, or `Eko2019` in an `if` statement.

```c
if (local_28 == 0x393130326f6b45) {
```

Taking a look at the data type of the `local_28`, declared at the beginning of this function, we notice it is a `longlong`. This means that the variable should 8 bytes in totality. We notice, however, that `0x393130326f6b45` is only 7 bytes in length. This behavior is indicatory that the string of `Eko2019` should be null terminated. The null character will provide the last byte needed for our purposes.

This is how this check is executed, in IDA.
