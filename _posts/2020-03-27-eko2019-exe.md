Introduction

I recently have been spending the last few days working on obtaining some more experience with reverse engineering to complement my exploit development background. During this time, I stumbled across [this](https://labs.bluefrostsecurity.de/blog/2019/09/07/bfs-ekoparty-2019-exploitation-challenge/) challenge put on Blue Frost Security earlier this year in September that requires both reverse engineering skills and exploit development skills. Although I would by no means consider myself an expert in reverse engineering, I decided this would be a nice way to try to become more well versed with the entire development lifecycle starting with identifying vulnerabilities to developing a functioning exploit.

Before we begin, I am using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and [IDA Freeware 64-bit](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/) to reverse the eko2019.exe application. I prefer to use IDA to view the execution of a program- but I prefer to use the Ghidra decompiler to view the code that the program is comprised of. In addition to the aforementioned information, this exploit will be developed on Windows 10 x64 RS2, due to the fact the I already had a VM with this OS ready to go. This exploit will work up to Windows 10 x64 RS6 (1903 build), although the offsets between addresses will differ.

Starting the application, we can clearly see the server has echoed some text into the command prompt where the server is running.

After some investigation, it seems this application binds to port 54321. Looking at the text in the command prompt window leads me to believe `printf()`, or similar functions must have been called in order for the application to display this text. I am also inclined to believe that these print functions must be located somewhere around the routine that is responsible for opening up the socket on port 54321 and accepting messages. Let's crack open IDA and open the application to see if our hypothesis is correct.

By opening the __Strings__ subview in IDA, we can identify the different strings that eko2019.exe will display based off of things like incoming connections, user input, etc.

As we can see from the above image, we have identified a string that seems like a good place to start! `"[+] Message received: %i bytes\n"` is indicative that the server has received a connection and message from the client (us). The function/code that is responsible for incoming connections may be around where this string is located. By double-clicking on `.data:000000014000C1A0` (the address of this string), we can get a better look at the internals of the eko2019.exe application.

Perfect! We have identified where the string `"[+] Message received: %i bytes\n"` resides. In IDA, we have the ability to cross reference where a function, routine, instruction, etc. resides. This functionality is outlined by __DATA XREF: sub_1400011E0+11E↑o__, which is a cross reference of data in this case. If we double click on `sub_1400011E0+11E↑o` in the __DATA XREF__ comment, we will land on the function in which the `"[+] Message received: %i bytes\n"`
