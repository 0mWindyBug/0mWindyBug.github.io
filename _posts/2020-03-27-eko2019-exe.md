Introduction

I recently have been spending the last few days working on obtaining some more experience with reverse engineering to complement my exploit development background. During this time, I stumbled across [this](https://labs.bluefrostsecurity.de/blog/2019/09/07/bfs-ekoparty-2019-exploitation-challenge/) challenge put on Blue Frost Security earlier this year in September that requires both reverse engineering skills and exploit development skills. Although I would by no means consider myself an expert in reverse engineering, I decided this would be a nice way to try to get more well versed with the entire development lifecycle starting with identifying vulnerabilities to developing a functioning exploit.

Before we begin, I am using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and [IDA Freeware 64-bit](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/) to reverse the eko2019.exe application. I prefer to use IDA to view the execution of a program- but I prefer to use the Ghidra decompiler to view the code that the program is comprised of. In addition to the aforementioned information, this exploit will be developed on Windows 10 x64 RS2, due to the fact the I already had a VM with this OS ready to go. This exploit will work up to Windows 10 x64 RS6 (1903 build), although the offsets between addresses will differ.

Starting the application, we can clearly see the server has echoed some text into the command prompt where the server is running.

After some investigation, it seems this application binds to port 54321. Looking at the text in the command prompt window leads me to believe that some type of print function must have been called in order for the application to display this text. I am also inclined to believe that these print functions must be around the routine that is responsible for opening up the socket on port 54321. Let's crack open IDA and open the application.

By opening the __Strings__ subview in IDA, we can identify what function the "[+] Server listening" message originates from.

Great! We have identified where this message comes from. If we double click on the address where the message is located (.data:000000014000C1A0), we can get a better understanding of what is going on inside of eko2019.exe around this location.

Perfect- we have identified where the message "[+] Server listening" came from. In IDA, we have the ability to cross reference where a function, routine, instruction, etc. This functionality is outlined by the __DATA XREF: main:loc_1400014EE↑o__, which is a cross reference of data in this case. If we double click on __loc_1400014EE↑o__ in the __DATA XREF__ comment, we will land in the function in which the "[+] Server listening" string exists.
