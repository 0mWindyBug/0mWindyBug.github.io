Introduction

I recently have been spending the last few days working on obtaining some more experience with reverse engineering to complement my exploit development background. During this time, I stumbled across [this](https://labs.bluefrostsecurity.de/blog/2019/09/07/bfs-ekoparty-2019-exploitation-challenge/) challenge put on Blue Frost Security earlier this year in September that requires both reverse engineering skills and exploit development skills. Although I would by no means consider myself an expert in reverse engineering, I decided this would be a nice way to try to get more well versed with the entire development lifecycle starting with identifying vulnerabilities to developing a functioning exploit.

Before we begin, I am using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and [IDA Freeware 64-bit](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/) to reverse the eko2019.exe application. I prefer to use IDA to view the execution of a program- but I prefer to use the Ghidra decompiler to view the code that the program is comprised of. In addition to the aforementioned information, this exploit will be developed on Windows 10 x64 RS2, due to the fact the I already had a VM with this OS ready to go. This exploit will work up to Windows 10 x64 RS6 (1903 build), although the offsets between addresses will differ.
