Introduction

While doing further research on ways to circumvent constraints on buffer space, I stumbled accross a neat way to append a second stage user supplied buffer of a given length to an exploit. Essentially, we will be utilizing the [winsock.h](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/) header from the [Win32 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/apiindex/windows-api-list) to write a few pieces of shellcode, in order to get parameters for a function call onto the stack. Once these parameters are on the stack, we will call the [recv](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-recv) function from __WS_32.dll__. This will allow us to pass a second stage buffer, in order to execute a useful piece of shellcode, like a shell. Let's get into it.
